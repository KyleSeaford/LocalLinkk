## Developing Robot Psql Backup

The robot will back up the Postgres database every day to
\\192.168.127.56\GarrysPool\samba\LocalLinkk\Backups\Database


### Creating the Cron Script

The bash script to set up a cron job that will run the Python script /var/www/fask/Locallinkk/Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\robot_psql_backup.py every day at 1 minute past midnight.

#### Steps to Use the Script

- Save the Script: Save the script to a file, for example, setup_cron.sh. The script is in the file.
[Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\setup_cron](Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\setup_cron)

- Make the Script Executable: Make the script executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x setup_cron.sh
```

- Run the Script: Execute the script to set up the cron job:

```bash
./setup_cron.sh
```

#### Explanation

Define the Cron Job Command:

```bash
CRON_JOB="1 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /var/www/robot_psql_backup.py"
```

This sets the cron job to run the Python script every day at 00:01 (1 minute past midnight).

Check if the Cron Job Exists:

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null | grep -F "$CRON_JOB")
```

This command lists the current cron jobs and checks if our desired job already exists.

Add the Cron Job if it Does Not Exist:

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "$CRON_JOB") | crontab -
```

If the job does not exist, it appends the new cron job to the current crontab.

Confirmation Message:

```bash
echo "Cron job added: $CRON_JOB"
```

## How to mount to garry
```bash
harry@templateunbutu:/mnt/garry$ sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.127.56/GarrysPool/samba/LocalLinkk/Backups/Database /mnt/garry -o username=samba,password=Garry32
```

Prints a message to confirm that the cron job has been added.

This script ensures that the cron job is added without duplicating entries if it already exists.


## Todo

- [x] Test backup script
- [x] run script to create cron job
- [x] Test email notification, bad db change pass, bad garry change output path
- [x] Mount Garry /mnt/garry/LocalLinkk/Backups/Database

- [x] Change .env to backup to garry, setting backupOutputPath
- [x] Finish read me Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\readme.md

# Development Notes from 1st July 2024

- Changed colors on help page
- Refined content on help page 

- Changed the image change endpoint to accept and decode base64 then save as a jpg:
```python
@api.route("/users/imageChange/<string:id>", doc={"description": "Changes the image of a user by ID"})
class Users(Resource):
    parserImage = reqparse.RequestParser()
    parserImage.add_argument('image', type=str, required=True, help='Base64 encoded image string')

    @api.expect(image_model)
    def put(self, id):
        logging.debug(f"Changing image by ID {id}")
        image_data = request.json.get('image')


        try:
            # Ensure the image data is properly formatted
            if ',' in image_data:
                header, image_data = image_data.split(',', 1)
            
            # Decode the base64 string
            image_data = base64.b64decode(image_data)
            
            # Create directory if it doesn't exist
            image_dir = f"profilePictures/{id}"
            if not os.path.exists(image_dir):
                os.makedirs(image_dir)
                
            # Save the image
            image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, 'profilePicture.jpg')
            with open(image_path, 'wb') as image_file:
                image_file.write(image_data)
                
            logging.debug(f"Image changed and saved to {image_path}")
            return {'message': 'Image changed'}, 200
            
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error changing image: {e}")
            return {'message': 'Failed to change image', 'error': str(e)}, 500   
```

- The user can change the profile picture on the profile page by pressing edit and choosing an image 
- NEED TO: Make the use state for the image change on all components 
- Added a select post size screen
- NEED TO: add text ad page
