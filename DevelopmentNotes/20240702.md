# Development Notes from 2nd July 2024  

## Investigation into the missing database backup

- `/var/www/fask/LocalLinkk/Robots/RobotPsqlBackup`
- The cron job should create a log /var/www/fask/LocalLinkk/Robots/RobotPsqlBackup/robot_psql_backup_cron.log
- It looks like the cron job failed because it ran an old job. The set up script will now remove any old job and create a new job.
- The cron script will also write a log output.
