# Development Notes 15th July 2024

## Fixed swear word validation 
- In `isSwearWordInAdvert` function, the swear words are joined into a single regular expression pattern with word boundaries (\b). This ensures that only whole words are matched. The re.search function is used to find any swear word in the text, and if a match is found, the matched word is returned. If no match is found, an empty string is returned.

- This approach will correctly handle cases like "hello" and "assignment" without flagging 
"hell" and "ass" as swear words.

```python
    # Join the swear words into a single regex pattern with word boundaries
    swear_pattern = r'\b(?:' + '|'.join(map(re.escape, swear_words)) + r')\b'
    match = re.search(swear_pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)

    if match:
        return match.group(0)
```

## Changed max advert length from 1000 to 400
```python
def is_valid_custom_advert(text):
    errors = []

    if isAdvertTooLong(text, 400):
        errors.append("Custom advert text must be less than 400 characters")
```

## Edited unit tests to account for changes

All tests passed!!!

## Added genre dropdown 
- The genre dropdown is basically identical too the catagories.
### Need to add:
- [x] Fetch Genres
- [x] Fetch Genre Children
- [x] Handle Genre Click
- [x] Render Genre Dropdown

- The button is used like this:
```javascript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={handleGenreClick}>
    <View style={styles.menuContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.menuContainerTEXT}>Genre</Text>
        <MaterialIcons name="category" size={24} color="black" />
    </View>
</TouchableOpacity>

{genreDropdownVisible && (
    <View style={styles.dropdown}>
        {renderGenreDropdown()}
    </View>
)}
```

- Both dropdowns set breadcrumbs however when going from category breadcrumbs to gere breadcrumbs it doesn't clear them.
- NEED TO: make the breadcrumbs clear
