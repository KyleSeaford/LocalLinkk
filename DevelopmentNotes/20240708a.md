## Removing the SD from the end of the location names

This SQL query will:

Update the name field in the locations table.
Use the TRIM function to remove the 'SD' string from the end of the name field.
Only apply this update to rows where the name field ends with 'SD' (using the LIKE '%SD' condition).

```sql
UPDATE locations
SET name = TRIM(TRAILING 'SD' FROM name)
WHERE name LIKE '%SD';
```

To confirm the SD has been removed

```sql
SELECT * FROM locations where name like '%SD' LIMIT 100
```
