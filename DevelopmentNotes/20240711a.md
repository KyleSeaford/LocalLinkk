# Development Notes 7th July 2024

## Companies Update

- added columns

```sql
created_date date,
created_by_user_id varchar(50),
```

- Manually updated all companies created date and user ID, to make it look like Kyle created all companies

```sql
update companies set created_date='2024-07-11',created_by_user_id='19d035c5-b5d0-4719-baa9-5e58450018e1'
```
